# # Practice: Geometry
#
# Write a program that can store and manipulate rectangles and points.
#
# Implement two classes: `Point` and `Rectangle` in modules named `point` and `rectangle` respectively.
#
# * Points should store their `x` and `y` coordinates
# * Rectangles should store their top left point, then a `w` width and `h` height
# * Both should have \_\_repr\_\_ and  \_\_eq\_\_ implemented
#
# Then create some top-level functions in those modules that know how to operate on instances of each class.
#
# In the `point` module:
#
# * Find the distance between two points
# * Return a new point moved by a specified amount
#
# In the `rectangle` module:
#
# * Know if a point is inside a rectangle
# * Find the center point of a rectangle
#
# All functions, even magic methods, should have tests.
#
# #### Advanced
#
# Create a bunch of Point instances and put them in a container.
#
# Then, Given a single Point instance, return all of the point instances within a given radius.
#
# #### Super Advanced
#
# Implement the Haversine formula to compute the distance between two given points on the earth.
